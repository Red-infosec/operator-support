# Operator Support

Operator is an autonomous red team C2 platform, built by [Prelude](https://prelude.org). You can download the latest copy of the desktop application [here](https://www.prelude.org/download/current), for either MacOS, Windows or Linux. 

> Did you know that the team at Prelude runs free red team training programs as part of our open-source outreach? We teach IT/InfoSec/DevOps/defenders/software engineers how to red team, so they can apply practical techniques to their day jobs. Reach out to us at support@prelude.org for more details.

This repository is a public spot to report issues and request features.

Here are the open-source repositories the platform hooks into:

- [Pneuma](https://github.com/preludeorg/pneuma): A cross-platform GoLang agent that connects to Operator and executes attacks.
- [Community](https://github.com/preludeorg/community): A collection of ATT&CK-classified procedures which Operator can send to agents, like Pneuma, to execute.

## Plugins

Inside this space, you will find the open-source plugins that are supported within Operator. Plugins are extensions to the 
Operator platform and allow you to add or overwrite behavior inside the application. Plugins here will automatically be available for installation
via Operator's plugin section.
